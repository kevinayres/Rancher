### Current state of this doc: Basically stable but with a very specific configuration. Need to explore other configs, including using JeOS for the VM nodes, GPU integration and using SUSE Enterprise Storage

.Prepare RKE nodes:
* For these tests, we configured:
** One VM for the single master node: 
*** 4 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 56GB HDD (6.9GB used after KF deployment)
** Two VMs for worker nodes:
*** 4 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 16GB HDD (12GB used after KF deployment)
*** 12 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 48GB HDD (19GB used after KF deployment)
* Minimal installation of SLES15SP1, with container registry
* All were deployed on the same 20 core/64GB server 
* Install and enable Docker on all nodes

.Deploy the Rancher server (on the KVM host or another host/VM)
* Can be on the same bare-metal host or elsewhere, however, better on the same host if deploying to VMs that are behind a NAT router
* Having a LAN routable IP on the host/VM is helpful to be able to reach the web UI
* https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/quickstart-manual-setup/

.Prepare NFS server (used master node VM in these tests)
* Basic NFS deployment
* Can use `sudo showmount -e` on the server to verify its serving and `sudo showmount -e <NFS server IP>` from the worker nodes to verify they have everything needed to mount

.Create a cluster through the Rancher UI
* Tried not to reuse cluster names between attempts to avoid unexpected conflicts
* Verify compatability between the Kubeflow version and the K8s version: https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/overview/
** As of early Fall 2020, v1.0.2 seems to be the best with K8s >= v1.15
* Use the "From existing nodes (Custom)" option
* Leave "Cloud Provider" set to None
* Under Advanced Options:
** Disable Nginx ingress
** Enable Pod Security Policies Support 
*** Select the unrestricted Default Pod Security Policy
* On the next screen, select "etcd" and "Control Plane" (deselect the "Worker" option) 
** Copy the docker run command and paste it onto the command line of the Master VM
** Click Done and wait for cluster to show green "Active"
* Select the "Edit" option from the right side of the cluster line 
** Deploy Rancher agent container with the Worker option on  the worker node VMs
** Click Save and wait for cluster to show green "Active"
* From top menu bar, point to "Global" or the cluster name, then select the cluster name just below it
* Select the "Kubeconfig File" button
** Copy the configuration into the ${HOME}/.kube/config file on a server with kubectl installed

.Deploy nfs-client-provisioner from Helm catalog
* From top menu bar, point to "Global" or the cluster name, then point to the cluster name just below it, then select "Default" project
* From top menu bar, select "Apps", then select "Launch"
* Search for "nfs-client-provisioner", then select it
** Under "Answers", paste the following into the first "Variable" answer box:
----
nfs.server=IPAddress
nfs.path=FullyQualifiedPath
storageClass.name=nfs
storageClass.defaultClass=true
----
*** Replace "IPAddress" with the hostname or IP address of the NFS server (RKE master node in these tests)
*** Replace "FullyQualifiedPath" with the fully qualified path of the NFS share
* Select "Launch" at the bottom of the page

.Deploy MetalLB load balancer from the kubectl server


* Pull and apply the MetalLB manifests
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/metallb.yaml
# On first install only
kubectl create secret generic -n metallb-system memberlist --from-literal=secretkey="$(openssl rand -base64 128)"
----

NOTE: It can be useful to configure MetalLB with at least one IP address that will not be auto-assigned and then specify that IP address for a critical service that should not be allowed to lose its external IP address to external DNS mapping.

* Set at least the default IP range and, optionally, the reserved IP range that will not be auto-assigned (Note that IP ranges can also be defined by CIDR notation. Adjust these variables and the configmap file as needed.)
----
export DEFAULT_IP_RANGE_START=
export DEFAULT_IP_RANGE_END=
export RESERVED_IP_RANGE_START=
export RESERVED_IP_RANGE_END=
----

* Create the MetalLB configuration file for layer 2 routing. See https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/ for other routing options and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/metallb/v0.9.3/manifests/example-config.yaml for lots of configuration options
----
cat <<EOF> metallb-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - ${DEFAULT_IP_RANGE_START}-${DEFAULT_IP_RANGE_END}
    - name: rsvd
      protocol: layer2
      auto-assign: false
      addresses:
      - ${RESERVED_IP_RANGE_START}-${RESERVED_IP_RANGE_END}
EOF
----

* Create configmap: `kubectl apply -f metallb-config.yaml`
* Verify the configuration was applied correctly (especially review the IP address pool): `kubectl get configmap config -n metallb-system -o yaml`
* Verify the MetalLB load balancer is running: `kubectl get all -n metallb-system`

* Test deploying a pod and service into the kubeflow namespace that picks an IP address from MetalLB (must have at least one IP not in use):
** Create the kubeflow namespace: `kubectl create ns kubeflow`
** Create the manifest for an nginx pod and load balancer service:
----
cat <<EOF> nginx-metallb-test.yaml 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx

        image: nginx:1
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 80
## START: Default StorageClass PVC test
## To disable testing PVC creation via the default StorageClass comment 
## out all lines from here through "## END: Default StorageClass PVC test"
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /mnt/test-vol
          name: test-vol
      volumes:

        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: nginx-pvc


---

EOF
----

NOTE: This will also test that a PVC can be created and attached to a pod by way of the default storage class. If this is not desired, comment out the appropriate lines, as described in the file.

** Create the pod, service, and (optionally) the PVC: `kubectl apply -f nginx-metallb-test.yaml -n kubeflow`
** Verify the pod is "Running", the persistentvolumeclaim is "Bound", and the service has an "EXTERNAL-IP": `kubectl get pod,pvc,svc -n kubeflow`
** Test that the service is reachable through the load balancer IP address from outside the cluster:

----
IPAddr=$(kubectl get svc -n kubeflow | grep -w nginx | awk '{print$4":"$5}' | awk -F: '{print$1":"$2}')
curl http://${IPAddr}
----

*** An HTML encoded output should be displayed that includes the phrase "Thank you for using nginx."

* When finished with testing, delete the pod and service: `kubectl delete -f nginx-metallb-test.yaml -n kubeflow`

===== Enable Istio

NOTE: This guide assumes Istio was installed when the RKE cluster was instantiated. 

* Ensure the cluster name is shown in the top menu bar
* Point to "Tools", then select "Istio"
* Select the appropriate version (1.4.10 for these tests)
* Under "Ingress Gateway", select "True" to enable
* Under "Select Type of...", select "LoadBalancer"
* Leave "Load Balancer IP" empty to allow MetalLB to assign an IP address
** (Optionally) Provide an IP address that is assigned to MetalLB but not in use

NOTE: It can be useful to configure MetalLB with at least one IP address that will not be auto-assigned and then specify that IP address for a critical service that should not be allowed to lose its external IP address to external DNS mapping.

* Select "Save" at the bottom of the page
* Wait until Istio becomes green
* Validate the istio-ingressgateway has received an IP address: `kubectl get svc -A | egrep --color 'EXTERNAL-IP|LoadBalancer'`
** (Optionally) Validate an external connection to an internal Istio service: 
*** Use the curl command to connect to a few of the *PORT(S)* listed for the istio-ingressgateway, i.e. `curl http://{$IPADDR}:15020`
*** At least one of the ports should return "404 page not found"

.Prepare the Kubeflow deployment files (best done from the kubectl server)
* Install the kfctl utility and place it in /usr/local/bin:
----
wget https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/download/v1.1.0/kfctl_v1.1.0-0-g9a3621e_linux.tar.gz
tar xvfz kfctl_v1.1.0-0-g9a3621e_linux.tar.gz 
sudo mv kfctl /usr/local/bin
kfctl version
----

* Configure the following variables (adjust as needed)
----
export KF_NAME=kubeflow-deployment
export BASE_DIR=${HOME}
export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}
export CONFIG_URI="${KF_DIR}/kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.2.yaml"
----

* Create and enter the ~/kubeflow-deployment directory: `mkdir -p ${KF_DIR} && cd ${KF_DIR}`
* Download the kfctl.yaml config file: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.0-branch/kfdef/kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.2.yaml`
* The following section of the kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.2.yaml manifest will install and enable Istio
** If Istio is installed and enabled, comment out the following lines, near the top of the kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.2.yaml file
----
  - kustomizeConfig:
      parameters:
      - name: namespace
        value: istio-system
      repoRef:
        name: manifests
        path: istio/istio-crds
    name: istio-crds
  - kustomizeConfig:
      parameters:
      - name: namespace
        value: istio-system
      repoRef:
        name: manifests
        path: istio/istio-install
    name: istio-install
----

* Download the Kubeflow build files: `kfctl build -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}`

===== Create a new pod security policy to support Kubeflow

NOTE: This section assumes there is not an adequate pod security policy available in the cluster and/or the user needs help in configuring one. The PSP created here is the most privileged and the least secure PSP possible. Use at your own risk.

* Create the PSP manifest file:
----
cat <<EOF> kubeflow-privileged-psp.yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  annotations:
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: '*'
  name: kubeflow-privileged-psp
spec:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
  allowedCapabilities:
  - '*'
  fsGroup:
    rule: RunAsAny
  hostIPC: true
  hostNetwork: true
  hostPID: true
  hostPorts:
  - max: 65535
    min: 0
  privileged: true
  runAsUser:
    rule: RunAsAny
  seLinux:
    rule: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: RunAsAny
  volumes:
  - '*'
EOF
----

* Create the new PSP: `kubectl apply -f kubeflow-privileged-psp.yaml`

.Update the kubeflow-edit and kubeflow-admin cluster roles in the cluster-roles.yaml manifest file to use the new PSP

////
* Create an aggregated cluster role file that will update the cluster roles during installation:

----
cat <<EOF> psp-update-kubeflow-edit-kubeflow-admin.yaml

---

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: psp-update-kubeflow-edit-kubeflow-admin
  labels:
    rbac.authorization.kubeflow.org/aggregate-to-kubeflow-admin: "true"
    rbac.authorization.kubeflow.org/aggregate-to-kubeflow-edit: "true"
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - policy
  resourceNames:
  - kubeflow-privileged-psp
  resources:
  - podsecuritypolicies
  verbs:
  - use
EOF
----
* Save a copy of the kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml file: `cp -p kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml /tmp/`
* Append the psp-update-kubeflow-edit-kubeflow-admin.yaml file to the end of the kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml file: `cat psp-update-kubeflow-edit-kubeflow-admin.yaml >> kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml`
* Verify the changes: `diff kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml /tmp/cluster-roles.yaml`
////

* Save a copy of the kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml file: `cp -p kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml /tmp/`
* Edit the kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml file
** Search for kubeflow-kubernetes-admin 

NOTE: Ensure the "resourceNames" refers to the correct PSP to be used.

** Insert the following lines under the "rules:" section of the kubeflow-kubernetes-admin ClusterRole:
----
- apiGroups:
  - policy
  resourceNames:
  - kubeflow-privileged-psp
  resources:
  - podsecuritypolicies
  verbs:
  - use
----
** Search for kubeflow-kubernetes-edit 
** Insert the same lines under the "rules:" section of the kubeflow-kubernetes-edit ClusterRole
** Save and close the file
* Verify that only the intended changes were made to the file: `diff kustomize/kubeflow-roles/base/cluster-roles.yaml /tmp/cluster-roles.yaml`

.Deploy Kubeflow

* Ensure these variables are still set correctly:
----
echo ${KF_NAME}
echo ${BASE_DIR}
echo ${KF_DIR}
echo ${CONFIG_URI}
----

* Start the deployment: `kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}`

* From another terminal, use the following command to monitor the kubeflow deployment: `watch 'kubectl get pods -A | egrep -v "Completed|Running"'`

** Over time, the number of pods that are in a state of `ContainerCreating` should decrease.

.Connect to the Kubeflow web UI

* Use the follow command to find the load balancer IP address (under EXTERNAL-IP) to connect to the Kubeflow UI: `kubectl get svc -n istio-system | egrep 'EXTERNAL-IP|LoadBalancer'`
* Connect to the Kubeflow UI through a web browser pointed to the external IP address on port 80

NOTE: During the first, successful test it took several hours for all of the deployments to deploy their pods. I really thought it was one of the worst failures to date, but many hours later I discovered virtually everything deployed correctly.

IMPORTANT: On every attempt at least one pod had not deployed correctly. If there are only a few, or less, Navigate to "Workloads" in the "Default Project" and delete one, wait for it to re-deploy correctly, then move on to the next one. It can take several minutes for each pod to finish re-deploying correctly.

CAUTION: I am still experiencing a situation where the kubeflow-edit cluster role loses the entries for the pod security policy that is assigned to it in the ~/kubeflow-deployment/kustomize/kubeflow-edit.yaml file. The result is that Jupyter Notebook can't deploy servers due to lack of a compatible PSP.
