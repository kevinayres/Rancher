=== RKE deployed on VMs
* Needs Docker installed
* Deploys everything via hyperkube as containers
** Can deploy onto a single host with Docker or an existing K8s cluster (likely needs Docker as the CRE) for HA
* Easy to deploy etcd, controlplane, and worker on a single node
* Deploying the first node, and it seems adding a node to the cluster, are the same command, but with --etcd --controlplan

=== Creating the custom SES storage class


NOTE: For some reason the action of K8s trying to mount an RBD image to a pod doesn't cause the rbd kernel module to load. Use `lsmod | grep rbd` to check it and `sudo modprobe rbd` to load it non-persitently

* Need to ensure the rbd kernel module is loaded on boot: `sudo bash -c "echo rbd > /etc/modules-load.d/rbd.conf"`

.Deploy the Storage Class via the UI
* Create the secrets with the command line first. They cannot be created through the UI

CAUTION: Creating secrets through the UI seems to only create them as type=Opaque. For the RBD SC, they need to be type=kubernetes.io/rbd. If not, PVC provisioning will fail with "Cannot get secret of type kubernetes.io/rbd"

IMPORTANT: When creating secrets through Rancher UI, do not base64 encode the admin and user secrets

* Select the cluster -> Storage -> Storage Classes
* "Add Class"
* Click in the "Provisioner" field
** Enter: kubernetes.io/rbd
** Select "*kubernetes.io/rbd (Custom)*" 
* Fill the fields under Parameters
* Will only accept an imageFormat of 1 or 2
** Note that secret fields need the name of the deployed secret, not the key alone
// * Need to make sure the ceph-common package is installed on all RKE worker nodes



=== Deploying pods, aka Workloads

.Select the cluster then the namespace, aka project
* Resources -> Workloads -> Deploy
* Select Global -> <cluster name> to work on non-namespaced resources (i.e. storageClass)
* Select Global -> <cluster name> -> <namespace> to work on namespaced resources (i.e. pods)
** PVCs are found under Resources -> Workloads -> Volumes

=== Working with Istio

.Generally configuring K8s LB
* Don't need an ingress controller to specifically assign open LB IPs to a svc
* An allocated LB svc IP doesn't seem to get plumbed at the O/S level (or perhaps, more specifically, in the host network namespace)
** Doesn't respond to ping
** Can be verified with `nmap -Pn <LB IP>`
*** Seems like the public ports allocated show as open

== Rancher Server
* Can use a single authentication service for all clusters
** Don't need each engineer to get a Google account, just to be able to have enterprise class access to clusters in GKE
* Will Chan says just sell Rancher support, nothing else. Everything else is add-on value.
* Hosted Rancher service runs on AWS for customers who want the control-plane to be 100% managed. 
** 99.9% uptime SLA for control plane
** Add-on to Platinum subscription
* Submariner connects overlay networks from various clusters
* Fleet - "GitOps at scale" create a pipeline that runs when a git repo changes and push it up to millions of K3s clusters.

== RKE vs. K3s vs. Skuba
* RKE: 
** Deploys from a single yaml file called cluster.yml
*** Create the file by downloading the rke binary from github, then running `rke config`
*** When the cluster.yml file is ready, install with `rke up` (likely need to be in the same directory)
*** kube_config_cluster.yml file is the kubeconfig file for the cluster
** Can be updated and re-applied to a running cluster
** Can generate Let's Encrypt certificates
** Saves etcd backups locally and on S3-compatible
** Upgrading is done by downloading a newer version of the RKE binary from github, then `rke up`
*** Can modify the order and method for upgrading the nodes

* K3s:
** Deploy with `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -`
** /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yml is the kubeconfig file

== Let's Encrypt certs and certbot:
* To update the SAN for an existing certificate: `/usr/bin/certbot certonly --cert-name rancher-demo.susealliances.com --dns-route53 -d rancher-demo.susealliances.com -d egress.susealliances.com -d samip-demo.susealliances.com`
* NOTE:
** Need the AWS credentials available. Exporting them with variables is pretty easy.
** Renews the cert as well. Can only renew the cert five times per week.
** The first SAN specified with -d is chosen as the CN in the cert, no matter what the name of the cert is.
* https://dev.to/nabbisen/let-s-encrypt-wildcard-certificate-with-certbot-plo
* To view the cert: `openssl x509 -noout --text -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/rancher-demo.susealliances.com/fullchain.pem | less`
